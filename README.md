# 🎓 SalaryScope — Student Placement & Salary Prediction System

SalaryScope is a Machine Learning project that predicts:

- Whether a student will be **Placed or Not Placed**
- The **Expected Salary** if the student is placed

It uses **XGBoost** for both tasks — a classifier for placement prediction and a regressor for salary prediction.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **XGBClassifier** → Predicts placement status (Yes / No)
- **XGBRegressor** → Predicts expected salary

The goal is to help students, colleges, and placement departments get data-driven insight into placement chances and likely compensation, based on academic and extracurricular performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yug-Gabani/SalaryScope.git
cd SalaryScope
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### 3. Train the models
Run the training script(s) inside the `Ml/` folder to generate the model artifacts (placement model, salary model, encoders, etc.) in `Outputs/`.

### 4. Run predictions
Use the prediction script inside `Ml/` and enter student details when prompted.

**Example output:**
```
Placement: Yes
Salary: 664454
```
